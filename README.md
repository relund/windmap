# Wind layer on maps using Shiny

Shiny application. See my [blog post](http://www.research.relund.dk/?p=592) for further info and the aplication on [shinyapps.io](https://relund.shinyapps.io/windmap).

Note to run the code file `forecastioApi_sample.txt` must be renamed to `forecastioApi.txt` and must 
include your [forecast.io](http://forecast.io) API key.
